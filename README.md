## Name
Fitness Posture Guidance System

## Description
This project is about tracking and analysing user's body movement and posture during a variety of fitness exercises, including bicep curls, shoulder press, squat and front raise. The system uses a webcam to capture real-time video of the user performing the exercise, and then uses mediapipe to detect and track the user's landmarks or joints to be able to calculate the angle and provide feedback for instructions. There are multiple feedbacks instructions shown on the screen to fix the user's posture with visual and audio feedback.



## Installation
To run and use this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from their official website.

Once you have installed Python, follow the instructions in the usage section.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
3. Run the python file called User_Interface.py to run the interface.
4. Select the desired exercise from the interface menu buttons.
5. Perform the exercise from the tutorial and follow the instructions provided on the screen to properly perform the exercise.
6. If you want to reset the counter of the repetitions you can click the reset button on the top right.
7. If you want to close the camera exercise window press 'q' to close it, pressing the x close button won't close it and it needs to be lower case 'q'.
Note that you will need a webcam or other video input device in order to use this system.
